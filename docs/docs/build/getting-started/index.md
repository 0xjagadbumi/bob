# Welcome to BOB

This is a guide to get you started with building on BOB. BOB is an OP Stack-based rollup and EVM compatible. This means that you can use the same tools and libraries that you are used to from Ethereum. In addition, BOB provides several useful tools to interact with Bitcoin.

Our docs are open source and we are happy to receive both [feedback](https://forms.gle/etYqChR3aahUFuEZ9) and [contributions](https://github.com/bob-collective/bob/tree/master/docs).

:::info Get Involved

This is alpha-stage software. We love to work closely with you to make BOB useful to your use-case and ideas. For help, feedback, and bug reports, talk to us in the #bob-devs channel in our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/interlay) server.

# Testnet

We have a public testnet running and all links can be found [here](https://app.conduit.xyz/published/view/fluffy-bob-7mjgi9pmtg). This page also contains a button you can click to connect your wallet to our testnet. For convenience, the most useful links are copied below:

- [Chain Explorer](https://explorerl2-fluffy-bob-7mjgi9pmtg.t.conduit.xyz)
- [Faucet](https://app.conduit.xyz/published/view/fluffy-bob-7mjgi9pmtg) - use the L2 faucet box. Sometimes this faucet fails, in which case you can use curl to directly call the API: 
`curl -XPOST -i https://faucetl2-fluffy-bob-7mjgi9pmtg.t.conduit.xyz/drip/[address]`.
- RPC: https://l2-fluffy-bob-7mjgi9pmtg.t.conduit.xyz

# BOB Stack

The BOB stack consists of the following parts:

1. Governance: Decisions in BOB deployments are made through an on-chain governance process.
2. Settlement: BOB receives security through L1 consensus. BOB uses a multi-rollup model where applications deployed on BOB can use both Bitcoin security as well as other L1 security like Ethereum or operate custom models for institutional use cases.
3. Execution: At the core, BOB uses the EVM as an execution layer for state transitions.
4. Rollup: BOB can be deployed on any EVM-compatible rollup or sidechain stack. This means that sequencing, data availability, and derivation specifics can direclty be inherited from the underlying stack such as OP Stack, Arbitrum, Starkware, zkSync, or any other EVM-compatible stack.
5. Bitcoin-augumentation: Bitcoin light client, abstraction of transaction fees via Account Abstraction and Meta Transactions.

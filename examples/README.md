# BOB Smart Contracts

This directory contains example smart contracts. The contracts are written in Rust using the [ink! framework](https://use.ink/). ink! is an [Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL)](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language) that uses attribute macros within standard Rust to define smart contracts.
